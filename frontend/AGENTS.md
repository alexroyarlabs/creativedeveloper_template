I want you to generate the complete code for a **Single Page Application (SPA)** with a very modern and professional frontend.

**Technology:**
- Framework: React (with functional components and hooks).
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Architecture: reusable components, folders organized by feature.
- Routing: React Router with multiple pages (e.g., Home, Products/Services, About, Contact, Dashboard).

**Design and style:**
- Visual style: very modern, like a B2B SaaS / tech startup.
- Use plenty of white space, clean and large typography, rounded corners, and soft shadows.
- Color palette: choose **one** of these options (and delete the others before running the prompt):
  - **Palette 1 – Tech blue**  
    - Main background: `#020617`  
    - Primary: `#1D4ED8`  
    - Secondary: `#38BDF8`  
    - Light text and backgrounds: `#E5E7EB` and `#F9FAFB`  
  - **Palette 2 – Futuristic purple**  
    - Main background: `#020617`  
    - Primary: `#4F46E5`  
    - Accent: `#EC4899`  
    - Light text and backgrounds: `#F3F4F6` and `#FFFFFF`  
  - **Palette 3 – Fresh cyan / mint**  
    - Main background: `#020617`  
    - Primary: `#06B6D4`  
    - Accent: `#22C55E`  
    - Light text and backgrounds: `#E5E7EB` and `#F9FAFB`  
  - **Palette 4 – Elegant dark mode**  
    - Main background: `#020617`  
    - Surfaces: `#111827` and `#1F2937`  
    - Primary: `#6366F1`  
    - Accent: `#FACC15`  
    - Text: `#F9FAFB`  
- Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Use consistent components (buttons, cards, tables, forms) with the **same style** across the app.

**Content and sections:**
- Header with logo and navigation.
- Hero section with main title, subtitle, and a clear call-to-action button.
- One or more content sections that visually explain the product/service (for example, cards or blocks with icons and text).
- A dashboard-like or panel section showing relevant data or information (can be lists, simple stats, etc.).
- Footer with secondary links and social media.

**Best practices:**
- Clean and well-structured code, with short comments where necessary.
- Clear and descriptive names for components and variables.
- Use props and state in an organized way, avoiding duplicated logic.
- Keep logic separate from presentation where it makes sense.

**Accessibility and UX:**
- Use semantic HTML tags (header, main, section, footer, etc.).
- Buttons and links should have clear hover/focus states.
- Ensure good contrast between text and background.

**Output:**
- Include all the code needed to run the app (index, components, routes, etc.).
- Briefly explain how to install dependencies and run the project with npm or yarn.
- If possible, include mock (dummy) data so that the components are not empty.

Adapt all these elements to an application about: **[DESCRIBE YOUR TOPIC HERE, for example: “project management”, “admin panel for an online store”, “course platform”, etc.]**.
